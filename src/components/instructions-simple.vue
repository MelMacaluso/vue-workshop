      How to build simple Vue apps
    </anchored-heading>
    <p>For the examples in this exercise, all you'll need is an <code>index.html</code> file with the base content below. As you can see, it's just a regular HTML file with Vue pulled in from a CDN, just like you would do with jQuery!</p>
    <code-block :code="htmlTemplate"></code-block>
    <p>There are also more complicated systems for building and using Vue components, most notably <a href="https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack" target="_blank">using npm and Webpack</a>, but we'll be starting with the simplest possible use of Vue, which will be applicable in most applications.</p>
