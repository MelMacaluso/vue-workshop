    <h2>How to build simple Vue apps</h2>
    <p>For the examples in this exercise, all you'll need is an <code>index.html</code> file with the base content below. As you can see, it's just a regular HTML file with Vue pulled in from a CDN, just like you would do with jQuery!</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My Vue App&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/vue/latest/vue.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;!-- CODE FROM EXAMPlES GOES HERE! --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>There are also more complicated systems for building and using Vue components, most notably using npm and Webpack, but we'll be starting with the simplest possible use of Vue, which will be applicable in most applications.</p>
